# Events

Events are how we actually process things that happen in the dungeon. They control everything we need to account for rewards, combat, etc.

Event rewards are often influenced by the Hero that is experiencing the event. For instance, there might be a feat that gives an additional 20% gold from rewards.

## Combat Events

- These events are the most dangerous, and most rewarding! They typically involve one or more monsters that fight the hero. If the hero lives, then the reward is granted. If the hero dies, the hero is dead forever (or until revived)

## Exploration Events

- These events typically just give rewards or maybe hurt the hero that is exploring. Maybe heal the hero.
